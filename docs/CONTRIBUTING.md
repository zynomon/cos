you must follow this three valid reasoning, 

1. your code mustn't have any kind of blunder or frequent comments, 
2. have common sense, and sense of humour. 
3. Don't print out real information for demonstration. if you are paranoid about security. we don't recommend you to.

# Good things to do
### if possible do these, 

---
- always try to make your code dynamic rather than static when possible. 
- add reasoning using comments on complex Lines, 
- always try to make the code organized , it means finish defining things where it started if possible that's.
